# SQL-COVID19-Data-Analysis

In this SQL portfolio project, using the deaths and vaccination data tables of Covid-19 from March 2020 to March 2023, I've done an exploratary analysis using basic to advanced SQL queries.

The raw dataset was downloaded from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

MS-SQL Server was used for data analysis
